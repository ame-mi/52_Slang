Project Name: Tetris with Hand Gesture Control

Project Description: This project is a classic game of Tetris adapted for hand gesture control using a camera. Players can control the game pieces through hand and fist movements, recognized via the MediaPipe library.

The project is implemented using Python and the following libraries: Pygame, OpenCV, and MediaPipe.

Technical Features: Gesture Recognition: Utilizes the MediaPipe library to identify key hand points. Hand size and fist positions determine the movements. Graphical Interface: Pygame handles the game board’s visuals and logic. Sounds and Music: Built-in sound effects accompany various actions. Camera: OpenCV is used to capture and process camera input.

How to Play: Run the program. In the main menu, choose “Start Game” to begin playing. “Instructions” to learn the controls. Control the game using gestures: Left fist clenched: The piece moves to the right. Right fist clenched: The piece moves to the left. Both fists clenched: The piece rotates. The piece falls automatically. Score 4999 points to win. The game ends if the pieces reach the top of the screen.
